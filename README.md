# Coyote
Coyote in Python pygame (learn and shiver)

To start: in Projects folder run "git clone https://github.com/Poehee/Coyote.git".
This WILL create folder "Coyote" (so don't "git clone" in a folder Coyote!)

Before committing you need to provide name and email (we want to know...)
Make sure to choose wisely between Individual and Global Solution.Individual solution (start with this, when drowning in projects check Global Solution)
